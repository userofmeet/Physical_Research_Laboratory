# UV Monitoring System 
**Final Year Internship @ PRL (Physical Research Laboratory)**  

This repository will store all my work, notes, code, and documentation related to the **frontend and backend electronics** of the Extreme-UV (EUV) Monitoring System being developed for future planetary missions.

---

## 📌 Project Summary
The instrument measures **Extreme UV radiation** using a detector which is an analog front-end.  
My work is focused on the **electronics**, which includes:

- Developing the front-end analog architecture 
- Reading analog data using an ATmega32  
- Sending the analog data to ADC128S102 via SPI protocol  
- Storing or transmitting the processed data  

This repo will be updated as the internship progresses.
