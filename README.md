# UV Monitoring System 
**Final Year Internship @ PRL (Physical Research Laboratory)**  

This repository will store all my work, notes, code, and documentation related to the **backend electronics** of the Extreme-UV (EUV) Monitoring System being developed for future planetary missions.

---

## 📌 Project Summary
The instrument measures **Extreme UV radiation** using a detector + analog front-end.  
My work is focused on the **electronics**, which might includes:

- Reading analog data using an **ADC**  
- Sending digitized data to a **microcontroller/DSP**  
- Doing basic processing (averaging, filtering, formatting)  
- Storing or transmitting the processed data  

This repo will be updated as the internship progresses.

## 📁 What This Repo Will Contain
- Notes and explanations  
- Block diagrams  
- Basic firmware code (ADC, communication, processing)  
- Testing logs  
- Any useful documents or references  

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Internship
To understand and help develop the **Data Acquisition System (DAQ)** for the UV instrument backend, and to get hands-on experience with:

- Embedded systems  
- ADC interfacing  
- Basic digital signal processing  
- Electronics testing
